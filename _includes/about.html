                <h2>Software Engineer and Architect</h2>
                <p>I have been a Software Engineer for over 10 years and filled an Architect role for the past year. I have worked primarily with <a href="#">Microsoft .Net</a> Enterprise Applications, focusing more on Web development through <a hreaf="#">ASP .NET</a>.</p>
                <p>Recently my interests in web development have taken me away from Microsoft technologies and I have worked with <a href="">Node.js</a> and it's associated technologies as well as Javascript frameworks such as <a href="#">AMD</a>.</p>
                <p>Grayscale includes full HTML, CSS, and custom JavaScript files along with LESS files for easy customization.</p>
